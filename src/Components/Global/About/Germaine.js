                Born in Redwood City, California, and raised in the Bay Area, Germaine joined the U.S. Army shortly after graduating high school. After
                seven years of service, she entered the world of finance. Starting as an account executive for a national commercial fleet leasing company
                she worked extensively with small business owners in the Midwest. Her career expanded as a financial and credit analyst.

                Later, as a Finance Director at a large commercial truck dealership, Germaine realized the importance of planning for the “what-ifs” in
                life. She realized how quickly a person’s fortunes could change after one of her long-time clients suffered a heart attack. Six-months
                later he was filing for bankruptcy. That event was the catalyst to her decision to embark on a career as a Financial Planner.

                Germaine started her Financial Planning career at Lincoln Financial Group in 2002. At Lincoln, she went through an intense
                training program acquiring in-depth knowledge of portfolio analysis and building, retirement planning, estate planning and
                business succession planning. Later, she entered the complex world of retirement income planning—before the concept had even
                become mainstream.

                In 2004, Germaine joined MassMutual Financial Group where she further developed her knowledge of insurance products and cash
                flow analysis. In 2009, Germaine joined Foothill Securities as an Independent Financial Planner. In December 2016, Foothill
                Securities became part of Securities America.
