                The overall purpose of the estate planning process is to develop a plan that will
                enhance and maintain the financial independence of you and your family as well as
                alleviate the financial impact of your death on those you leave behind. Estate
                planning is a continuous process. Sometimes changes in your life - such as a sudden
                increase in wealth, a new marriage or remarriage, the birth of a child, a serious
                illness or a death in the family - can trigger the need for an estate plan
                evaluation.  A well-constructed estate plan may not only reduce the tax bill, but
                also help your loved ones understand, resolve and prepare for many of the issues that
                arise when settling an estate.
