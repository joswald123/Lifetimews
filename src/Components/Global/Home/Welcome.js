                With over 30-years of experience in the financial services industry, Germaine
                Cordes founded Lifetime Capital Financial Group to help her clients achieve
                financial stability and peace of mind. Her client’s peace of mind comes from

                to them and to make better financial decisions. Lifetime Capital leverages the

                We help our clients pursue their goals, by walking them through a step-by-step
                process that provide clarity and solutions. As a “holistic” financial planner, care is
                taken to optimize wealth creation, minimize taxes, and achieve tomorrow’s
                retirement income needs. The goal, to live a better life without worrying about
                money.
